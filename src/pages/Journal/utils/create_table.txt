  'Yesterday was the last day of 2021. We woke up in Provo and ended up partying at Chandlers with Grant and Liz.\nWe woke up and Anne was feeling sexy so I rubbed her off. I probably would have tried to do it, but the condoms were in the car and I just couldn&apos;t bring myself to go get them in the cold snow.\nThe hotel we stayed at was much nicer than the one we usually stay at in Provo. We both slept a lot better. I got up and cleaned the snow off the car and went to get us coffees. I went to Rugged Grounds; that place is great. Filled up with gas on the way back to the hotel and we got out of the hotel pretty quickly and easily.\nThe drive was mostly chill. I drove for four hours straight. We talked for much of that and then listened to a little podcast. We talked about our New Year&apos;s goals and thoughts about the last year.  It was a good talk.\nWe got home and had to shovel our drive and walkway. That took a while and my back is unhappy with me today because of it. But it was fun. We unpacked everything and I spent a little time on my computer messing with my new little project&mdash;trying to get this journal information sorted and displaying in some sort of web app.\nThere are a few steps to that: I think the biggest is learning how to set up a backend "server" to store and retrieve the data. It shouldn&apos;t be that hard, but I&apos;ve definitely never done anything like that. I&apos;ll probably use Python, but at some point I&apos;d like to update to Rust.\nAfter shoveling the drive and unpacking I tok a shower and Anne wanted to "take a nap", so we got in bed and did it. Good times!\nWe had plans with Grant and Liz to go out to dinner and we went to Chandlers, reservation at 2130. We had a bottle of champagne practically all to ourselves before they got here and then off to the restaurant. It was a great meal, though I&apos;m not sure it was $420 great. But we had a good time.\nWhen we got home I basically just flopped into bed, while Anne brushed her teeth and did some bedtime stuff. When she got in bed   she was trying to snuggle up on me and I wasn&apos;t having it. But she asked   what was wrong and I opened up and realized she was wearing some lingerie.   Woohoo. So we did it again. What a way to ring in the New Year.',
