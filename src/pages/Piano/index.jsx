        . I also play the piano for their choirs, student recitals, student
        juries, and faculty concerts.  I started working with the College of
        Idaho in the fall semester of 2019.

        In the fall of 2023 the college&apos;s choir director stepped down
        suddenly and I was lucky and prepared enough to step in as the choir
        director and finished out the academic year. That effectively meant that
        I was a full time faculty member during the &apos;23-&apos;24 year.

        In the spring of 2024 I was offered a full-time position as piano
        faculty at the college and I accepted! I&apos;m happy to be continuing
        my work there. I have some 15 piano students, I play for the choirs
        (under the direction of a new choir director, Mark Perry), and teach a
        few piano related classes (keyboarding skills and class piano; maybe
        soon a piano literature class).
