        <h1>The First Blog Post</h1>
        <br>
        <p>I just wanted to put a little disclaimer here that I'm not sure I'm any good at writing. In fact, I'm quite sure I have a long way to go before I am any good.</p>
        <br>
        <p>But I'm ready to have a public record of my progress in the tech world.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I should have started writing this a long time ago. When I started programming I did start writing a blog, but it turned into a journal and I wasn't really trying to put that out on the internet for the world to see. So let's try again.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I might try to put up one or two new posts a month at first. Let's see how that goes.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Right now I'm working through <a href="https://www.nand2tetris.org/" target="_blank">Nand2Tetris</a>. I'm on the Chapter 3: Sequential Logic (<a href="./ch3_sequential_logic.pdf" download="Sequential Logic.pdf">pdf</a>), and I found the first thing they don't really explain: how you build what's called a D Flip Flop. After doing some googling, I have found it's pretty complicated, so maybe my first blog post will be me trying to explain how they work? That would be a good challenge.</p>

        <p>A little code:</p>
        <code>console.log("Hello, World!");</code>
      </div>
      </main>
    </div>
  </body>
