        <p>Last year, my wife and I decided to leave New York City for the road, and we bought an RV and did just that. I studied programming part time during that year while I worked half-time as a bookkeeper for the <a href="https://brooklynyouthchorus.org/" target="_blank">Brooklyn Youth Chorus</a>.</p>
        <br>

I moved to New York City in 2011 and worked as a pianist there for 7 years&#x2014;played Carnegie Hall, Joe's Pub, off-Broadway shows, worked for NYU and the <a href="https://brooklynyouthchorus.org/" target="_blank">Brooklyn Youth Chorus</a> as a vocal coach and staff pianist. <a href="./privateblog/" style="text-decoration: none;">I</a> rode my bicycle a lot.</p>
