# my personal website

this is the repo for my personal website, located at travish.com, hosted on digital ocean.

## write the readme

i need to sit down and write the readme, but that means figuring out what i actually want in here. i
think it will involve reorganizing how this thing is built. right now i have a sort of monorepo set
up where all my little projects are *just copied* (?!) in here. i probably should learn git modules
(?) and modularize my projects to be consumed by the website repo. we'll see.
